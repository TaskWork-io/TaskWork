# 🛡️ TheGridHub Security Status - ALL CLEAR

This document summarizes current security posture for TheGridHub deployments (Vercel + Supabase).

## ✅ Security posture
- Dependency audits: npm audit shows 0 vulnerabilities (CI validates on each build)
- Static analysis: CodeQL for JS/TS, ESLint (security rules) in CI
- Secret detection: TruffleHog scan in CI, Dependabot reviews
- Container/FS scans: Trivy (SARIF uploaded)

## 🔐 Runtime hardening
- HTTP headers: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- CSP: default-src 'self'; connect-src includes required provider endpoints; no object/frame embedding
- Next.js: poweredByHeader disabled
- RLS: Supabase Row Level Security enabled with owner-only policies; webhooks use service role

## 🔭 Observability and logging
- App logs table (app_logs) for server events
- Stripe webhook event log (idempotency)
- Vercel Analytics (optional) and provider dashboards

## 📋 Deployment checklist
- Environment variables set in Vercel (app + integrations + Stripe)
- Database schema pushed (Prisma) and Supabase migrations applied
- Stripe webhook configured to /api/webhooks/stripe
- Smoke tests pass: scripts/smoke.js
