## üîí Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. Request arrives with authentication token
2. Token is validated against authentication provider (Clerk)
3. User admin status and roles are verified from database
4. Session is validated for consistency and timeout
5. Request proceeds to authorization layer

### Authorization Flow
1. Route-specific permission requirements are identified
2. User's roles are mapped to available permissions
3. Context-aware checks are performed (time, resource ownership, etc.)
4. Access is granted or denied with audit logging

### Data Protection Flow
1. Sensitive data is encrypted before database storage
2. Field-level encryption uses context-specific keys
3. Data is decrypted only when accessed by authorized users
4. PII is redacted in logs and non-production environments
5. All data access is logged for compliance

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Controls by Admin Function

### User Management
- **Permissions**: user:view, user:edit, user:delete, user:suspend
- **Protection**: Can't modify other admins (except super admin)
- **Encryption**: Email, phone, address fields encrypted
- **Audit**: All user modifications logged with before/after values

### Payment Management  
- **Permissions**: payment:view, payment:refund, payment:dispute
- **Protection**: High-value refunds require super admin approval
- **Encryption**: Stripe IDs and billing addresses encrypted
- **Audit**: All payment operations tracked with amounts and reasons

### System Configuration
- **Permissions**: system:config, security:config
- **Protection**: Critical settings require super admin
- **Encryption**: Sensitive configuration values encrypted
- **Audit**: Configuration changes logged with impact assessment

### Analytics & Reporting
- **Permissions**: analytics:view, analytics:export
- **Protection**: PII redacted in exports based on role
- **Audit**: Data exports tracked with record counts

## üö® Security Monitoring

### Real-Time Alerts
- **Failed Login Attempts**: 10+ attempts in 5 minutes
- **After-Hours Activity**: Critical operations outside business hours
- **High-Volume Operations**: 50+ user modifications in 1 hour
- **Suspicious Patterns**: Automation tools, attack patterns

### Threat Detection
- **IP Reputation**: Automatic blocking of suspicious IPs
- **User Agent Analysis**: Detection of bots and attack tools
- **Request Pattern Analysis**: Rate limiting and anomaly detection
- **Risk Scoring**: Dynamic risk assessment for requests

### Audit Monitoring
- **Compliance Tracking**: GDPR, SOX, HIPAA, PCI compliance
- **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual admin behavior patterns
- **Data Access Tracking**: All sensitive data access logged
- **Security Metrics**: Dashboard for security team monitoring
