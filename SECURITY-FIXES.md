# 🔒 TaskWork Security Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. **Nanoid Vulnerability (Moderate → Fixed)**
- **Issue**: Predictable results in nanoid generation when given non-integer values
- **CVE**: GHSA-mwcw-c2x4-8c55
- **Fix**: Updated nanoid from `<3.3.8` to `^3.3.11`
- **Impact**: Improved randomness and security of ID generation

### 2. **AI SDK Security Update (Breaking Change)**
- **Issue**: Transitive dependency on vulnerable nanoid version
- **Fix**: Updated `@ai-sdk/openai` from `^0.0.67` to `^2.0.23`
- **Impact**: Latest security patches and improved API

### 3. **AWS CDK v1 Deprecation Issues**
- **Issue**: Multiple high-severity vulnerabilities in deprecated AWS CDK v1
- **Fix**: Removed deprecated `@aws-cdk/aws-lambda` dependency
- **Impact**: Eliminated 25 high-severity and 1 low-severity vulnerabilities
- **Note**: SST handles CDK dependencies internally, so manual CDK deps not needed

## Updated Dependencies

### Production Dependencies
```json
{
  "@ai-sdk/openai": "^2.0.23",     // Updated (was ^0.0.67)
  "nanoid": "^3.3.11",             // Added explicit version
  // ... other deps remain the same
}
```

### Development Dependencies
```json
{
  "aws-cdk-lib": "^2.214.0",       // Kept (SST manages CDK)
  "@types/aws-lambda": "^8.10.152" // For Lambda type definitions
  // Removed: @aws-cdk/aws-lambda (deprecated)
}
```

## Security Validation Commands

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Run security linting  
npm run lint

# Type checking (helps catch security issues)
npm run type-check

# Full security check
npm run security:check

# Pre-commit security validation
npm run pre-commit
```

## Ongoing Security Measures

### 🔄 Automated Security
- **GitHub Actions**: Security scanning on every push
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
